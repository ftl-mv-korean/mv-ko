# A note on auxfiles

A large portion of the auxiliary files in `auxfiles-ko/` were originally translated by Team Waldo for vanilla FTL and
FTL: Captain's Edition. Unfortunately we could not contact them for license due to their nature of anonymity.

If you're one of the original translators for these files and wish to claim rights on them, please leave an issue to
the repository so that we may contact you.

`auxfiles-ko` 내 대부분의 번역된 파일들은 팀왈도가 번역한 FTL 바닐라 및 FTL: CE 번역물로부터 사용된 것입니다. 아쉽게도
팀왈도의 익명성으로 인해 라이센스 관련 문의를 하려 했으나 연락이 되지 않았습니다.

만약 해당 파일들을 번역했던 번역자이시고, 이 곳에 수록되길 희망하거나 혹은 번역물에 대한 권리를 행사하고자 하신다면,
본 저장소에 이슈를 남겨주시기 바랍니다.

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
