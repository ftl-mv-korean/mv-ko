<textList name="TEXT_LIGHTSPEED">
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Around you swirls distant stars and planets as they fly past at breakneck speed.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. The mild concern of smashing into a planet crosses your mind, but you figure some sort of security system is in place to prevent that. Hopefully.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. It's amazing to think long ago the idea of travelling between worlds in a matter of minutes to hours was nothing but a fantasy.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You hope the light doesn't mind that you've showed them up.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Old Earth scientists would be proud to know their research wasn't in vain.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You can feel the gentle vibrations running down the ship. It would be relaxing, if it wasn't for the giant space rocks flying towards your ship at alarming speeds every few seconds.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You make a quick trip to the engines to listen to the FTL drive hum away as it works.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. The journey to the next sector will hopefully be quick. The Rebel fleet might be fast, but they still can't follow you through hyperspeed.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You catch a brief glimpse of what you think might be another ship in hyperspeed as well, but they quickly pass by.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. It must be an interesting life as a Civilian who never leaves their home planet. It's a tough choice sure, but the life of a traveller is one you'd never pass up.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Your Multiverse drive is still charging. It can take months for it to be ready for the next reality jump, but your mission here isn't over yet anyways.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Not to be confused with Multiverse travel, hyperspeed is merely the process of travelling from system to system, or sector to sector.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. While it can take mere minutes to travel between two beacons, it can take hours to travel between sectors. Fortunately this delay applies to all ships, including the Rebels.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Your journey to the next sector should hopefully remain uneventful. Dead-space, as it's called, is the territory between sectors, and is known to be mostly empty.</text>

	The Galactic Union is widely mocked for its name - don't be fooled. It's far from galactic, though its leaders would like to make you think it is. The Union is an alliance of many various previously independent corporate states. While primarily populated by humans, the Union has become the sanctuary for many alien refugees during recent times.</text>

Apparently, agents sent by the Crystalline Empire working for the "Sister-Species Liberation Group" have taken residence among the outcasts as well.</text>

	The Duskbringers are much more aggressive than the Zoltan Ministry, and their sectors are a testament to it. Even worse, the Duskbringers and Rebels used to work in junction, and only recently split as the local and interdimensional forces feud over whether to maintain their alliance. It's unlikely you'll see many friendly faces here.</text>
