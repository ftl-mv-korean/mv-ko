BUG/ISSUE FIXES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Quest and exit beacons have nubs now.

Fixed a few events not having combat preparations.

Fixed the tuco and casino encounters having the wrong win events.

Fixed the automated fuel surrender using the wrong text.

Fixed orchid teleport taking a long time.

Fixed the zoltan pulsar encounter in the black market having an asteroid field.

Fixed not being able to hold a ritual in the last stand.

Fixed the known "issue" with the background crashes from special background beacons being loaded on-top of each other. This didn't normally affect gameplay much, but it caused issues with a new feature being added. This increased the file size a bit (as some backgrounds had to be duplicated) but hopefully its worth it.

Fixed Ancient Beam using the Ancient Focus sprite.

Improved shading on some slug ships.

Fixed some shading issues on Rock Transport.
