 OTHER NOTES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

For people using the console, do not warp to the any sector while at a sector start beacon, or other event with special background (Zoltan Eye, Harmony Link, Fed Base), it will crash the game. The reason for this is unknown, but should have no effect on standard gameplay.
