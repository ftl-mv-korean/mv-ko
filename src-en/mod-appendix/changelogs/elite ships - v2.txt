 NEW FEATURES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Added the Radiant (shell), Operative (militia), and Radical (duskbringer) cruisers.

Increased the Inquisition Cruiser's missile count by 15 missiles.

Completely redid the Sentinel Cruiser gimmick to be immune to system/hull damage but have absolutely no defenses.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
BUG/ISSUE FIXES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Restructured the XML to append the ships using the normal append method. This should prevent the wierd ship duplication issue some people had when using other ship packs.

Fixed Ulitity Bots from healing super fast and not damaging enemy crew.

The advanced respirators do not work, so Phantom Cruiser now has normal respirators instead.
