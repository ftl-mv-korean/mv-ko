OTHER CHANGES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

With hyperspace's new functionality for non-standard room sizes, Multiverse adds in support for the following custom room sizes (which means you will not have to make your own no-o2 symbols for these rooms if making a ship mod for Multiverse):
1x1, 3x3, 1x3, 3x1, 2x3, and 3x2.

Reworked the way last stand crew checks work, so now its tied to a hidden augment rather than separate events.

The internal name of the splashes has been changed to describe their text rather than a number.
