 NEW FEATURES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Added an optional lore dump to the start beacon

Added the Node 17 Memorial Event. Save the city and deliver Tully's package for a unique reward unlike any other...

Enemy Federation ship beam artillery only pierces 3 shields and is slower

Ghost ships no longer spawn with oxygen

The Engi Last Stand judge gives Engine Pre-Igniter instead of Adv. FTL Nav

Added the Emergency Manual augment, which adds more pre-fight preparations. Starts on Militia A and Civilian A

Added a new Harmony Cruiser type B

Engi Virus event gives a Engi Defender when reborn

Swapped Engi Med-Bots on Harmony C to Defense Scambler

Ghosts now have a new sprite and come in different colors

BUG/ISSUE FIXES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Fixed saboteur jobs not working

Fixed some tpyos

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 OTHER CHANGES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

To make the ghost image change, their internal name had to be changed to "ghosty" (originally "ghost"). This should be fixed in all events and ships, but if you see a human in place of where a ghost should be, or a ghost blue option is not working, report it so it can be fixed.

Temporarily made the big rebel fleet ship invisible since it would spawn in Fed sectors when the PDS was enabled
