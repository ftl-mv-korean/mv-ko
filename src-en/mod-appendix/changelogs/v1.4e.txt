The wierd bug where peaceful ships teleport crew onto your ship for no apparent reason if they have a teleporter is known, but we aren't sure what causes it. We're working on it.

We've noticed a potential nebula sector crash. Happens very rarely to only certain people, and we can't seem to replicate it. If you encounter this bug please let us know and give as many details as possible. (equipment, sector #, if it was regular nebula or a different type of nebula sector, etc)
