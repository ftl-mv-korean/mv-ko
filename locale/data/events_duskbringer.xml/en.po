"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\tDeeper into the hideout you eventually find a main lobby, surprisingly cosy for a once science outpost and now ex-terrorist hideout, with a man in grey armor sprawled on a couch with his arm dangling off, waiting for you. \"Good, good. You made it. Was wondering how long until you'd get here, after I spied your ship near that Monk's hideout. Idiotic green freaks couldn't contain their temper even when I told them to wait, and look where it got them! Blown to smithereenes.\" The man gets off the couch, revealing himself to be of an impressive height. He peels off his painted MFK helmet and places it on the table and reaches out his hand. \"I, on the other hand, aren't so stupid as to tangle with Renegades. The name's Saggitarius. Well, not really. The name's Jack. But Vael calls me Saggitarius, one of his goofy lil' nicknames.\" He flashes a smile and extends his hand even further across the table, demanding you shake it."

Get's 'em every time.\" The mercenary spins around and flops back onto the couch. \"So, with the pleasantries out of the way, shall we begin? I think we shall! If you're observant and knowledgeable - no offense if you aren't! - you'll likely have noticed I am an Angel. One of the Syndicate's goons, minion for Vael, bla bla bla. I'm a Mercenary, a good one. I get things done. I know Renegades and Mercenaries have some bad blood but we're both in the business of efficiency. And I think I've found a way for us both to be very efficient together.

Indeed, Mr. Rei exists in a grey zone between 'patriot' and 'rebel' to the aspiring youth of the Ministry.

Where's the fun in this line of work if you don't set the scene first!\" The Angel clears his throat. \"Now, where was it? Oh yes. You see, Devorak has become the poster child of the entire Duskbringer movement! His face alone has convinced countless Zoltans to betray the Ministry. He's seen as a moderate amongst all of these 'terrorists'. Someone reasonable and rational, turned against only the corrupt Ministry officials who caused all of this mess.

At such a pivotal moment in the Duskbringer movement... well it'd be quite disastrous, yeah? This whole Universe 1 backstab though? Very, very advantageous. Say... a Rebel killed Devorak before he ever had the chance to denounce the Duskbringers, yeah?\" Jack snaps his fingers at you and nods. \"That would be VERY advantageous indeed. It'd be the Rebels crossing one final line, and the Ministry isn't going to do anything of course. It's just enough to convince some gullible youth they need to do their part in avenging the fallen hero. Now given enough time surely it'd happen naturally, but time isn't on my clients' side.\""

"Devorak steps away from Jack and draws his sword, aiming it at the sky. \"I, am Devorak Rei. To many of you, I am a hero. Perhaps to some, I am a radical. To me, I think I am both of those things, or perhaps even neither. I am a soldier who was turned bitter by war, and in my bitterness I let myself be betrayed by the Federation. I let the unjust actions of some few Union corporations and an underground Rebel insurrection channel, in all their efforts to bury the contributions of the Ministry to every major Federation War, take on the illusion as the actions of the entire Federation. I let myself be preyed upon by malicious, radical forces because they said they could change the galaxy and that's exactly what I wanted to hear. I wanted to believe the Duskbringers could solve all my problems. But they can't. The Duskbringers ARE the problem! As long as this Multiverse stands divided as it is, we will never be free of the Rebel plague or any other threat that might come over us. Fascism, nationalism, they're only pathways to decades of strife and death. How could a Federation that once stood so united in striking down the equally villainous Inquisitions now break apart so easily?\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tDevork swings down his sword and aims it at one of the camera drones, which have now moved in closer and begun to circle him. \"To my Zoltan brethren, now is your chance to change the future. Should you call yourself a Duskbringer now, it is never to late to lay down your armor and your weapons, and abandon this terror. Should you be questioning your loyalty to the Federation or the Ministry, just think of what cause you would be giving up, just to become a mindless soldier to a group whose idealogies nearly mirror that of the so hated Rebellion! And should you still be a faithful Ministry or Federation ally, it is still your duty to ensure the everlastingness of this peace. For as long as those like the Duskbringers are at large in this galaxy, you and your peace will never truly be safe.\" Devorak bows, then stows his sword. Around him, many more Zoltans emerge from the shadows of the building behind you and yell various things against the Duskbringers. Even some dock workers and other civilians join in, and a few Duskbringer vessels from the fight above start to jump away.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tAs the cameras start to drift away to catch the scene elsewhere, Devorak turns to you. \"I cannot discern what intentions you truly had, coming here today. However, if you did come to have me killed, you have shown your mind changed. What would I have learned, if I turned you away now after making a journey similar to mine?\" Devorak looks behind him. \"Unfortunately, I don't... really have anywhere to go now. I didn't think this far ahead. I need some place to keep this worn out corpse that carries me, so uh... do you need any help on your mission perhaps? I have a ship in storage, it means a lot to me but I don't think I can ever fly it again. You may have it now, I guess. Just don't get it blown up.\""
