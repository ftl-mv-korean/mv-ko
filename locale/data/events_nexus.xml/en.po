He offered a deal, and allowed a trio of three to scout out a new home for the refugees. However, when the P-Day event almost spread to an adjacent cluster, Prime panicked and pulled the plug. He condemned them all to die, and stranded the scouts in a foreign land with no help nor home. Fortunately, I was able to reach out to them, though it wasn't easy.

"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA Sylvan in the back raises his hand, and Normal Sylvan groans. \"Yessss, Apple Sssylvan, we prepared sssliccced Ssslugsss for you to eat inssstead.\"\n"

"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Now then, firssst order of busssinesss. We have identified the emergencccce of a new cataclysssm, one which the C.E.L.'s negligenccce hasss overlooked. Giant sssentient pea-podsss have taken over Reality-6783!\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne of the Sylvans in the front of the room coughs, which seems to anger Normal Sylvan heavily. \"Did I ASSSSK for your opinion, Ssssylvan from the reality where everyone isss a giant sssentient pea-pod? Your reality is weird asss hell, hah! Peas are grossss. And people don't even ssspontaneously catch fire when they sssay 'hypnothize'- AAAAAAAH\" Normal Sylvan spontaneously catches fire and falls off the stage, prompting chaos to break out in the room. One Sylvan in particular stands up to protest, \"Why do we even come to thessse? We sstarted thessse becausssse we felt Prime wasssn't acknowledging our cluster'sss ssstake in thisss empire, but honessstly? Prime isssn't that bad. He doesssn't yell at usss, we live comfortably and he keepsss the Multiverssse ssafe!\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe other Sylvans break out into furious debate with each other, throwing things across the room. Before you can even consider interrupting or leaving, a gigantic beam slices its way through the station, sending all of the chairs spiraling out into the abyss as well as a couple Sylvans until the repair gel springs into action."
