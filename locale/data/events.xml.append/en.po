Orchids also will often (but not always) use powerful missile-like weapons called Kernels that guaruntee a breach but still use ammunition.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tFree Mantis - A hyper-friendly but somewhat dimmwitted sect of Mantis rogues. They have very powerful boarding ships, but will usually only attack when they percieve your actions as hostile. Beyond that, they will likely be very happy to see you.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tThe Militia - The militia is a band of civilian volunteers who protect civilian space. As they are a sub-group of the Galactic Union, a member of the Federation alliance, they should only bother you if you break the law in their presence.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tShell Geniocracy - The Shells usually keep to the nebulas and place a heavy value on science. They have a heavy dependance on oxygen but their ships will usually have a very strong set of defenses."

While they've had issues with the Federation in the past, they usually like to keep to themselves, sometimes to such an extreme their ships only have 1 or 2 crew aboard!\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLost Suns - Though technically allied with the Federation, the Lost Suns are an aggressive and radical group of fire obsessed Rockmen currently engaging in a violent civil war with the authoritarian Rockmen Elders.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Ghosts - The Ghosts aren't actual paranormal entities, but are rather made mostly of the same gaseous substance as the nebulas they usually reside in. The Ghosts take little to no interest in politics, usually preferring to just live aboard the wrecks of abandoned vessels.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExotic Hunters Guild - The EHG is a group of Slug hobbyists and hunters who like to hunt a special kind of game... the sapient kind. All the same, they're usually welcoming to tourists of all species and hold no special ill-will to the Federation."
